/**
 * AgentScan reporting repo - the state singleton + outbox behind the
 * `agentscan_report` sync lane (migration 073).
 *
 * ── The diff scan, not writer hooks ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `enqueueEligibleActivity` is the ONLY producer of outbox rows. It diffs
 * `agent_activity` against the outbox's `UNIQUE (activity_id, status)` pair,
 * so it captures both brand-new rows and status transitions idempotently -
 * with ZERO code in the money-path writers. Completed outbox rows are kept
 * forever as the report-log; deleting them would let the scan re-enqueue the
 * same pair on every tick.
 *
 * ── Claim-and-stamp (crash-safe drain) ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `claimDueOutbox` bumps `attempt_count` and pushes `next_attempt_at`
 * (exponential, capped 1 h) BEFORE the caller sends, exactly like the
 * launch-attribution lane: a crash mid-send retries after the backoff instead
 * of hot-looping, and the server deduplicates retried batches, so re-sending
 * is always safe. `rescheduleOutbox` overrides the stamp when the server
 * answered with its own `Retry-After`.
 *
 * ONE GENERATION PER TICK, READ WITH THE CREDENTIALS. The lane reads
 * `agentHash`, `ingestToken` and `registration_generation` in a single
 * `getReportingState()` and carries that generation into the incremental
 * enqueue, the claim and every TERMINAL write (`markOutboxSent`,
 * `markOutboxRejected`, `rescheduleOutbox`). Each of them applies only while the
 * singleton still carries it - see `writeOutboxAtGeneration` for the in-flight
 * send a 401 reset would otherwise lose, and `enqueueEligibleActivity` for the
 * insert that reset would be unable to relabel.
 *
 * ── What never goes in here ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `last_error` carries status/code words only ("429 rate_limited"), never
 * response bodies and never the ingest token. The eligibility predicate keeps
 * rows the ingest contract cannot express (the approval roles the server's enum
 * does not contain) out of the outbox entirely.

 *
 * `allowance` / `allowance_reset` are absent because the server's role enum does
 * not contain them, so every such event would be rejected item by item.
 * Approvals are still recorded locally; they simply have nowhere to go.
 *
 * `wrap`/`unwrap` are in the server's vocabulary and DO have a producer in this
 * install now (the `WalletWrapPrepare`/`WalletWrapConfirm` pair). They are still
 * left out, and the gate is named rather than assumed: adding `'wrap'` to the
 * kind list and the `wrap`/`unwrap` roles to the role list is blocked on a LIVE
 * confirmation that the AgentScan server's ingest accepts kind `wrap` for both
 * directions INCLUDING the pending states. A kind the server rejects costs batch
 * items, and an amount it cannot verify costs strikes, so the vocabulary is
 * proven against the running server before rows are sent, not inferred from the
 * enum it publishes.
 *
 * NOTHING IN THIS PREDICATE IS A STATEMENT ABOUT THE SERVER, and reading it as
 * one was a real defect (the final review of 2026-09-06, lane 7). Both versions it
 * compares are LOCAL: `vocabulary_version` is what this database can STORE and
 * `backfill_vocabulary_version` is what a scan on this install has COVERED.
 * Neither can say whether the deployment accepts a role, and a role the
 * deployment does not carry used to come back as a per-item `validation_failed`
 * and be marked rejected FOREVER. The capability half lives where it can be
 * measured - `../../agentscan/server-capability.ts`, on the ingest response, with
 * the row left OWED - and the two gates are independent: this one decides whether
 * a row may be enqueued at all and how it is labelled, that one decides whether
 * the deployment can take it yet.
 *
 * `pools_fee` WAS such a gap and is now closed, by the lane that owns the pools
 * launch writer (PR5). WHAT THE HISTORICAL ROWS MEAN, decided there and recorded
 * here because this predicate is what acts on it: a `pools_fee` row is THE SAME
 * FEE a `vex_fee` row on a launch is - the same 25 bps, on the same
 * `launch_msg_value` basis, to the same Vex treasury, charged by the same leg -
 * written under the venue-named spelling the vocabulary used before migration
 * 107 unified it. It is history, not a different charge, so it is admitted
 * beside `vex_fee` on the launch arm rather than left unreportable. New rows are
 * written as `vex_fee` (`@tools/pools-fun/fee/venue.ts`), so this arm stops
 * gaining members the day migration 107 landed and covers a closed population.
 *
 * `wallet_transfer` and the `transaction` kind's five roles are absent for the
 * same reason as `wrap`: present in the server's vocabulary, never proven live.

/**
 * THE BACKFILL GATE ON THE WIDENED VOCABULARY, and the defect it exists to
 * prevent.
 *
 * Widening the reportable vocabulary makes rows that ALREADY EXIST newly
 * eligible. The scan runs in two modes: the one-time BACKFILL (`backfill =
 * TRUE`, "this is history") and the incremental tick (`backfill = FALSE`, "this
 * just happened"). Whichever runs first claims the whole newly-eligible
 * population, because a completed outbox row is never re-enqueued and never
 * re-sent. If the incremental tick got there first, months of historical claim
 * rows would reach the server labelled as live activity - a lie it has no way to
 * detect and this install no way to correct.
 *
 * So the new vocabulary is admitted only when BOTH hold:
 *   - the database carries the widening (`vocabulary_version >= N`), and
 *   - this scan is either the controlled backfill itself, or it runs after a
 *     backfill THAT COVERED THIS VOCABULARY completed
 *     (`backfill_vocabulary_version >= N`).
 *
 * N is per ARM, not per build: the launchpad family is gated at 2 and the
 * historical launch-fee population at 3, so an installation that covered 2 keeps
 * reporting the family live while only the arm it never scanned waits.
 *
 * THE SECOND CONDITION IS A VERSION AND NOT A TIMESTAMP, and that is the whole
 * point of it. `backfill_enqueued_at IS NOT NULL` says only that SOME backfill
 * ran; it cannot say which vocabulary that backfill scanned. A build at
 * `AGENTSCAN_VOCABULARY_VERSION = 1` running against a database migration 107
 * has already stamped at 2 - an older binary on a migrated install, which is an
 * ordinary state during a staged rollout - performs a V1-ONLY scan and, under
 * the timestamp gate, leaves a mark the next V2 build reads as "the family
 * history is covered". Every historical claim row then reaches the server
 * labelled live activity. The version stamp is written by the marking
 * transaction with the version the scan actually ran under, so it can only say
 * what was really covered, and a V1 mark cannot satisfy a V2 gate.
 *
 * That is the VS Code one-time-migration shape (a durable done-marker, the work
 * skipped when it is present, the marker written after the work) applied to a
 * set query: migration 107 resets the marker, the next periodic run enqueues the
 * history under it, and every incremental tick before that mark refuses the new
 * roles instead of stealing them.
 *
 * `$1` is the scan's own backfill flag, cast so Postgres reads it as a boolean
 * in both the predicate and the inserted column.

 * The diff scan enqueues the pair `(activity_id, a.status)` - the row's status
 * as it stands NOW - so the pending snapshot of any row is only ever produced by
 * a tick that RAN while the row was pending. For every other role that is
 * harmless: a row that confirms between two ticks simply reports its terminal
 * event, which the server inserts on first sight
 * (`activities-ingest-repo.ts` INSERT arm).
 *
 * A launch waiting on the venue's keeper is the one row for which it is not.
 * Its terminal event is HELD by {@link SETTLEMENT_NOT_STILL_OWED_SQL} until the
 * keeper settles - minutes to hours - and if no tick happened to run between the
 * row's creation and its confirmation, it has no pending event either. The
 * activity is then INVISIBLE on AgentScan for the whole wait: created, confirmed
 * and reported nowhere (Codex round-3 blocker 5C, reproduced on real Postgres).
 * K3's "the pending snapshot still reports immediately" only ever held when a
 * tick fell in that window.
 *
 * So a confirmed row whose keeper purchase is still owed also projects the
 * PENDING snapshot it never got to send. That is not a second reporting path:
 * it is the same outbox pair every other row produces, in the order the server
 * expects - a pending insert now, its single `pending -> terminal` promotion
 * when the payout is known. The `NOT EXISTS` diff makes it exactly once (a row
 * that already sent its pending snapshot inserts nothing here), and the server
 * ignores a pending event for a row it already holds as terminal
 * (`PROMOTE_PENDING_ACTIVITY` requires `status = 'pending'`), so this can never

 * commits. The push lane reads registered state at G, passes its guards, and a
 * concurrent 401 reset then commits G+1 and relabels every non-rejected row as

 * it either - its enqueue is the same diff, and the pair is already taken by the

 * is later sent to the server as live activity. No later reset needs to happen
 * for that to be the end state: an exhausted rate budget or a retryable send
 * failure is enough to leave the row sitting there.
 *
 * So the scan takes the singleton `FOR SHARE` (a reset holds it exclusively, so
 * a scan arriving mid-reset waits and then reads the new generation) and inserts
 * only while `registration_generation` still equals what the caller read
 * alongside its credentials. When it moved, nothing is inserted and the caller

/**
 * THE FENCE EVERY TERMINAL OUTBOX WRITE PASSES THROUGH.
 *
 * The defect it closes (Codex final review, round 2): the periodic and push
 * lanes claim different batches concurrently. Request A commits on the server
 * but its response is delayed; request B comes back 401, the drain resets the
 * registration (every non-rejected row unsent, `backfill = TRUE`, generation
 * G+1); A's delayed 200 then arrives and writes `sent_at`. That row is now
 * "already sent" AFTER the reset that made it owed again, so it is silently
 * omitted from the full resend the reset exists to produce. Under
 * `resetIdentityForRecovery` it is worse than a gap: the event stays attached to
 * the identity that was abandoned and never reaches the new one.
 *
 * `atGeneration` is the generation the lane read ALONGSIDE the `agentHash` and
 * `ingestToken` this batch was sent under, handed down through the claim (which
 * refuses at any other generation), so a terminal write is fenced on the
 * credentials that produced it rather than on whatever the claim happened to
 * observe. Two halves, and both are needed:
 *
 *   - `SELECT ... FOR SHARE` on the singleton SERIALIZES this write against a
 *     reset. A reset holds the row exclusively (its own UPDATE), so a write that
 *     arrives mid-reset blocks here until the reset commits and then reads the
 *     new generation. Without it, the write could slip in between the reset's
 *     state UPDATE and its outbox relabel and be undone silently - which is
 *     correct by luck, not by construction - or read a pre-reset snapshot.
 *   - the same generation is restated as a PREDICATE in the UPDATE itself, so
 *     the row write and the fence are evaluated by one statement against one
 *     committed state, never by two.
 *
 * When the reset won, the write applies to nothing: the row stays unsent and
 * backfill-marked, exactly as the reset left it, and the caller is told
 * `stale_generation` so it can report the rows as still owed instead of as sent.
 *
 * This is VS Code's `handleSaveSuccess`
 * (`agents-colab/vscode/src/vs/workbench/services/textfile/common/textFileEditorModel.ts:953-964`):
 * a write that SUCCEEDED downstream may only clear the dirty flag if the
 * model's `versionId` did not move while it was in flight; otherwise the success
 * is real and the model stays dirty. Adopted verbatim in shape. What differs is
 * the failure vocabulary: VS Code silently traces, and metamask-core's
 * `#updateTransactionInternal` throws when the record it re-reads is gone
 * (`agents-colab/metamask-core/packages/transaction-controller/src/TransactionController.ts:2616`),
 * because their caller aborts the whole flow. Ours returns a typed outcome,
 * because a stale batch is ordinary weather on this lane and the drain has to
 * keep accounting for the remaining rows.
