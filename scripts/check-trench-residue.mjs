/**
 * Trench Express RESIDUE gate.
 *
 * Migration 108 retired the Trench Express protocol: its ten tools, client,
 * ABI, fee venue, handlers, prompts, dialog lane and IPC domain are deleted.
 * What the deletion cannot prove on its own is that nothing was MISSED - a
 * stale registry row, an orphaned prompt sentence, a UI string that still
 * offers a launchpad the app can no longer reach. This gate scans the source
 * tree and the live docs for `trench` in any casing and fails on every
 * occurrence that is not on the measured allowlist below.
 *
 * REPO-WIDE, NOT DIFF-SCOPED, unlike its siblings `check-no-em-dash.mjs` and
 * `check-test-unsafe-escapes.mjs`. Those police what a branch ADDS; this one
 * asserts a property of the whole tree, and a residue gate that only looked at
 * added lines would pass on the very tree it exists to describe.
 *
 * ── WHY THERE IS AN ALLOWLIST AT ALL ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "No `trench` anywhere" is not achievable and would not be correct. Historical
 * rows must stay readable (owner decree: AgentScan shows them as "Trench
 * Express (legacy)"), and reading them means naming the durable values they
 * carry: the `trench` protocol discriminator, the `trench_fee` / `token_launch`
 * activity roles, the `trench_express` launchpad, the AgentScan wire enum. A
 * gate that forbade those would only be satisfiable by renaming durable data,
 * which is the one thing a retirement must not do.
 *
 * So the allowlist is a MEASUREMENT, and every entry carries the reason its
 * path legitimately still names the retired protocol. Two rules keep it honest:
 *
 *   1. an entry whose path no longer contains the token FAILS as stale, so the
 *      list shrinks as the residue does and cannot quietly outlive it;
 *   2. an entry may not be added to park work. The question it answers is
 *      "why does this file still have to say this?", and "we did not get to it"
 *      is not an answer.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS OUT OF SCOPE, and why each exclusion is not a hole ─────────────
 *
 *   - `db/migrations/`: durable SQL, including 062/063/082 which CREATED the
 *     tables under their original names and 108 which retired them. Rewriting
 *     an applied migration is forbidden.
 *   - `sync/legacy-trench-express/`: the kept historical decoders. Naming the
 *     protocol is their entire purpose.
 *   - `tools/tool-surface-spec/`: dated planning and audit records. They are an
 *     archive of decisions taken at a point in time; editing them would falsify
 *     the record rather than clean the tree.
 *   - generated output (`__toolsnaps__`, `__promptsnaps__`, `__goldens__`) and
 *     captured fixtures: outputs, not sources. A residue there is fixed at the
 *     generator or the capture, which this gate does scan.
 *   - `node_modules`, `dist`, and anything git does not track.
 *   - TEST FILES (`__tests__/` and `*.test.*`). This is the one exclusion that
 *     is a JUDGEMENT rather than a category, so it is argued rather than
 *     asserted. A test's job is to pin the behavior of the code it covers, and
 *     what the surviving code legitimately still names is exactly what the
 *     production entries below already state a reason for: the durable
 *     `trench` / `trench_express` / `trench_fee` values, the historical ledger
 *     mapping, the legacy decoders, the retirement migration itself. Scanning
 *     tests would therefore need roughly seventy allowlist entries restating
 *     reasons already given one layer up, and a list that long stops being read.
 *     The gap it leaves - a test still referencing something deleted - is not
 *     silent: such a test cannot import and the suite goes red, which is how the
 *     one real instance (`integration/agentscan/attest.int.test.ts` importing
 *     `@tools/trench-express/constants.js`) was actually found.
