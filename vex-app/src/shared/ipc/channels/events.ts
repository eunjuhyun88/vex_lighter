   *    query. Lease metadata is bounded to `leaseActive` +
   *    `leaseExpiresAt` — owner IDs are internal runtime state.

   *    turn as an EPHEMERAL, sanitized preview (token text, tool-call
   *    status WITHOUT raw args, usage, done, error). The renderer replaces
   *    it with the persisted message DTO on `transcriptAppend`.

   *    resume FAILS. Before it, background failures died in a log and a
   *    provider 429 reached the user as "Unable to process the message".
   *    Payload is BOUNDED CODES ONLY — category, error type/class, status,

   *    stay server-side, the same doctrine that keeps
   *    `memory_jobs.last_error` out of every DTO.

   *    surface (draft patch, readiness flip, contract acceptance, approval
   *    enqueue) so those surfaces stop discovering state by polling.
   *  - `compactionPreparation` (compaction v2) fires after a COMMITTED
   *    `compaction_preparations` transition. Payload is METADATA ONLY —
   *    session id, the closed status enum, a `summaryReady` boolean and a
