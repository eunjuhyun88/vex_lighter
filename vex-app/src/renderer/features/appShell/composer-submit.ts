/**
 * Composer chat-turn submit orchestration (extracted from
 * `SessionComposer.tsx` so the parent stays under the file-size budget).
 *
 * Owns: the notice state machine, the mission-run free-text gate, the
 * retryable-failure notice contract, the stop acknowledgment, the message
 * queue (a submit while a turn is in flight queues instead of dropping,
 * and the head auto-drains when the session goes idle - A27), and the
 * welcome→create hand-off that fires a freshly created session's first
 * turn, and the board's Ask VEX hand-off (A4) - which reaches the agent
 * through the SAME dispatch every typed message takes, so the board modal
 * needs no submit path of its own. The draft itself lives in the per-session draft store (B1). No JSX.
 * Stop-availability reading is split into `composer-submit/`.

  /**
   * ONE route per case — never both.
   *
   * FOREGROUND (`submitPending`): the request-local `stopTurn()` only. This
   * window owns the in-flight request and `processAgentTurn` observes that
   * AbortSignal directly, so the abort is immediate and complete. Firing the
   * durable route as well would INSERT a `stop_terminal` control row that no
   * consumer on the foreground path ever observes — it outlives the turn it
   * was meant for and is later applied to an unrelated approval resume or
   * continuation, stopping something the user never asked to stop.
   *
   * BACKGROUND (stoppable, no pending submit — a live slice, a `loop_defer`
   * park, or an unknown state we fail open on): the durable
   * `runtime.requestStop` only. `stopTurn()` has nothing to cancel here — the
   * work belongs to a wake-driven continuation this window never started — and
   * the durable row is exactly what that path's consumer observes. It is also
   * the correct route when availability is UNKNOWN: the engine decides what, if
   * anything, there is to stop, and answers honestly (`no_active_run`) when
   * there is nothing.
   *
   * The split is the point: each route is the one the running work actually
   * listens to, and neither leaves a row behind for work that is not running.
