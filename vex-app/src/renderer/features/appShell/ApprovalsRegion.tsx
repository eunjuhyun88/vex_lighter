/**
 * Inline approval region (F3 — restricted-mode unblock).
 *
 * Mounted in `SessionPanel` between the transcript and the composer for an
 * active session. `useControlStateLiveSync` (F5) now pushes a pending-approval
 * refresh on `EV.engine.controlState`, and `useMissionUpdateLiveSync` pushes
 * `approval_enqueued` straight from the enqueue transaction, so a newly-paused
 * run surfaces near-instantly. The REFETCH_INTERVAL_MS poll is retained as a
 * SLOW fallback (5s → 60s once the push landed): an event can be dropped at
 * the preload Zod gate or fire before the renderer subscribes.
 *
 * Codex F3 constraints honoured:
 *  1. `Result.ok === false` is surfaced as an inline error — TanStack `isError`
 *     would not catch app-level `Result` failures.
 *  2. Bounded height + `overflow-y-auto` so multiple pending approvals cannot
 *     push the composer off-screen.
 *  3. Only the FIRST newly-appearing card gets `focusOnMount`. Subsequent
 *     refetches that include the same id no longer re-focus.
 *  5. (Mount test) — `__tests__/SessionPanel-approval.test.tsx` asserts that
 *     the selected-session path renders a pending approval card via this
 *     region (directly protects the bug fix).
